        <h3>Alternative to colored light bulbs</h3>
        <p>You want <strong>colored light bulbs</strong> but they're expensive and you don&amp;'t want to have boxes
            full of them ? How about keeping your low enery fluorescent or <strong>LED lights</strong> and adding
            <strong>Silicolights</strong> ! Choose your favorite <strong>color</strong> and <em>just light it</em> !</p>

        <h3>The simplest interior design idea</h3>
        <p><strong>Silicolight</strong> <em>Classics</em> are available in 2 different <strong>transparencies</strong>:
            <strong>Bright</strong> and <strong>soft</strong>. </p>
        <p> <strong>Bright</strong> color : Allows to change the color of the light while keeping a good level of
            brightness in the room.</p>
        <p><strong>Soft</strong> color : Perfect for a warm and cosy <strong>atmosphere</strong> for watching a
            <em>movie</em>, a <em>candle light dinner</em>, a game of <em>poker</em>, or as a <em>nightlight</em> for
            the kids or when they have a <em>sleepover</em>.

            <strong>Silicolights</strong> measure <strong>42mm</strong> in diameter and <strong>60mm</strong> in depth.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>They are easily adaptable to bulbs from <strong>42mm</strong> to <strong>45mm</strong> in diameter.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For bulbs with a diameter greater than <strong>45mm</strong>, the use of a silicon lubricant or any
                    other heat resistant lubricant is highly recommended in order to avoid damaging the bulb.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For bulbs with diameters between <strong>39mm</strong> and <strong>42mm</strong>,
                    <strong>Silicolights</strong> will easily hold on if you add a rubber band between the bulb and the
                    <strong>Silicolight</strong>. To create the ideal band, take a <strong>white Silicolight</strong>
                    and cut 5mm off its opening end and then slide this band from the top of the bulb downward. This
                    will hold your <strong>Silicolight</strong> in place.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Silicolight - Spot lights</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Silicolight Spot lights, available in 10 colors and one level of transparency, are specially
            designed to fit fluorescent and LED spot lights.

            With a diameter of 50mm, they are a perfect fit for most of the standard size spot lights you can find in
            stores. Not only will they give your lighting the color you want, they will make your LED lights less
            eye-straining with a softer beam.

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">Compact fluorescent bulbs do emit a small amount of UV rays that may have a
                    tendency to fade the pigments in the silicone. Some models will emit more UV rays than others. The
                    most UV sensitive colors among the Silicolights are: bright pink, purple, red and orange. Yellow,
                    blue and green are not affected by UV rays. LED lights do not affect the color pigments of the
                    Silicolights as they do not emit UV rays.</p>
